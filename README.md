# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis
Analysis of Cyclistic bike-share data to identify usage patterns between causal riders and annual members using R
# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal is to analyze historical trip data from "Cyclistic," a bike-share company in Chicago, to understand how annual members and casual riders use the service differently.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Language:** R
* **Libraries:** tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, readr), lubridate
* **Platform:** RStudio Desktop

## 📊 Key Findings
* **Casual Riders:** Prefer longer trips and use the service most heavily on weekends.
* **Annual Members:** Use the bikes for shorter, consistent daily trips, likely for commuting.
* **Business Recommendation:** Develop a "Weekend-Pass" membership or seasonal marketing targeting casual riders to convert them to annual subscribers.
